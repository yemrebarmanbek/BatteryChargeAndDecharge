Battery Controller for Charging and Discharging of Battery Model:
The Battery Controller Model is designed to control the charging and discharging of a battery in an efficient and safe manner. It consists of a Coulomb Counting based State-of-Charge (SoC) measurement system, which accurately measures the battery's level of charge. The Battery Controller Model ensures that the battery is charged to its full capacity without overcharging, and discharged without damaging the battery.

Coulomb Counting Model for SoC measurement:
The Coulomb Counting Model is a simple and effective method for measuring the battery's level of charge. It calculates the SoC by integrating the current flowing in and out of the battery over time. The Coulomb Counting Model is based on the principle that the total charge that flows in and out of the battery is equal to the change in the battery's state-of-charge. Therefore, by measuring the current flowing in and out of the battery, the Coulomb Counting Model accurately estimates the battery's level of charge.

The Battery Controller Model with Coulomb Counting based SoC measurement is a reliable and efficient system for charging and discharging batteries. It provides accurate measurement of the battery's SoC, ensuring that the battery is charged and discharged safely and efficiently. With this model, you can control the charging and discharging of your battery with confidence, knowing that it is being done in the most optimal way possible.
